Debuggin Log for Tetris.java

I encountered numerous errors when developing this game, mostly due to logical errors within my code. Here are a few:

1) The Board.java class will run a seemingly impossible to reach statement that reaches an out of bounds array location in the game board. The "tetriminoDropCheck" method 
   checks if the block is near the edge, passes it, and then an exception was reached in the "tetriminoDrop" method.
Solution: Upon further investingating, I remembered that the shape arrays for the Tetrimino class often have a blank section at the bottom (to allow rotation). If a block
	  is above that blank section, the "tetriminoDropCheck" will allow it to drop (as it is still valid), but the "tetriminoDrop" method will try to update the array
	  entirely, including the "out of bounds" blank section. As such, modifying the if statement in the "tetriminoDrop" method easily prevents this from occurring.

2) The Board.java class will attempt to search beneath a block for any conflicts (collisions) in the "tetriminoDropCheck" method. However, upon running the method, it appears
   to ignore blocks that clearly would be considered a "collision", and the falling tetrimino fazes through it.
Solution: Upon reviewing my code, I realized that the "tetriminoDropCheck" method was not viewing the correct row, but also may view itself as a collision. As such, I reworked
	  the "tetriminoDrop" method to erase the existing block, before performing the check, and then recreating it (either one down, if valid, or in the same place, if not
	  valid)
